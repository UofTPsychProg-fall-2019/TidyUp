# TidyUp
problem set 8

In this problem set, you will practice your tidyverse skills by cleaning up an IAT dataset, similiar to the one you worked with in the Pandorable problem set. This time it's a little messier (i.e., closer to the original data that is available at https://osf.io/szwuf/). To cut down on the file size, a trimmed down .csv version of 2019's data in this repository for you to work with.

This is an individual assignment, but as always please feel free to solve problems together. Happy cleaining!
